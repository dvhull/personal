		<h1>AR Painter: Augmented Reality Painting App</h1>
		<video autoplay loop muted playsinline src="media/demo-compressed.mp4"></video>
		<p>
			AR Painter is an augmented reality app that allows users to draw brush strokes and have those brush strokes hidden behind objects in the real world. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea stemmed from trying out various augmented reality drawing apps and realizing that created brush strokes couldnâ€™t be moved or deleted. Furthermore, the virtual objects are not <a href="https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/context_awareness/depth/occlusions.html" class="link">occluded</a> meaning they were always rendered in front of real-world objects making the experience less immersive. 
		</p>

		<h2>Technology</h2>
		<p>
			The app was built in Unity using <a class="link" href="https://lightship.dev/products/ardk/">Lightship's ARDK</a> because it supports occlusion for the largest range of devices. Though Unityâ€™s <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.0/manual/index.html" class="link">ARFoundation</a> supports occlusion for Android and iOS as well. ARFoundation uses Appleâ€™s ARKit which approaches occlusion using LiDAR. Meaning that only apple devices that have LiDAR support occlusion with ARFoundation. 
		</p>

		<h2>Paint Tool</h2>
		<p>
			Google open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush" class="link">Tilt Brush</a> in 2021. I took the tube brush specifically from Googleâ€™s Tilt Brush repository and translated it into augmented reality.

		<h2>Selection Tool</h2>
		<p>
			Originally I used a sphere to select multiple brush strokes at once however the problem with this approach is the user has to be very close to the brush stroke to select. Furthermore, it was very confusing when asking others how they would use this tool.  
		</p>

		<p>
			I ended up going with a simple cursor. You hold down to move brush strokes or selections. To select or unselect the brush strokes you tap the screen. To scale the selection you use two fingers. The larger the distance between your fingers is the bigger the selection will be. The closer the distance is between your fingers the smaller the selection will be.  
		</p>

		<h2>Grid Tool</h2>
		<p>
			I noticed sometimes when drawing objects it was very hard to see what the mesh looked like since I am using an unlit material for the brush strokes. For the user to better see what the mesh looks like I added the grid tool. I took this idea from Quill VR which also has unlit brush strokes but has a similar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRPjhyh9BfY&t=12s" class="link">feature</a>.

		<h2>Erase Tool</h2>

		<h2>Record Video</h2>

		<h2>Future Steps</h2>
		<p>
			The most important future step is in the select tool there is no group button currently for selected brush strokes. So every time you want to move a group of brush strokes you have to re-select them which can be very tedious. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In current video recordings, the recording button remains in the recording. In the future, it will be good to remove any UI buttons from the video recording.
